    <p>To make the quandong jam, heat the grapeseed oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the quandongs, onion, garlic, chilli, tomatoes and lemongrass and stir for 5 minutes or until just soft.  Add the brown sugar and water, then bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for  20 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat, then stir in the lime juice and chopped coriander.</p>
    <p>Season fish to taste with salt. Heat a good drizzle of grapeseed oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook the fish, skin side down for 5 minutes or until the edges start to turn a golden brown and the fish is three quarters cooked through. Flip the fish and cook for another minute or until just cooked all the way through.</p>
    <p>To serve, place a large spoonful of quandong jam on each plate. Top wtih the fish, skin-side up, then scatter with coriander sprigs and serve with lemon wedges.</p>
